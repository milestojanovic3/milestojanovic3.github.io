                        During the last few months, InfoQ has talked with some of the most well known and respected figures in Software Architecture trying to identify new trends coming up or discussing the evolution of the ones that have been gaining wider adoption. From basic principles that are still so important like Domain Driven Design and a Clean Software Architecture to Microservices and Service Meshes, we picked the brain of people like Martin Fowler, Uncle Bob or Vaughn Vernon in an effort to empower the community to innovate faster and build better software.

                        If you decide to make the investment and put aside 2 hours to go to this playlist or enjoy them separately (30 minutes each) you will be inspired. Hopefully, you will also share the knowledge with your teams and accelerate the software side of our progress, putting your company at the front of this development.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Evolutionary architecture is a broad principle that architecture is constantly changing. While related to Microservices, it’s not Microservices by another name. You could evolve towards or away from Microservices for example.</li>
                        <li>Services do not form an architecture. They form a deployment pattern that is a way of decoupling and therefore has no impact on the idea of clean architecture.</li>
                        <li>Vlingo is an open source system for building distributed, concurrent, event-driven, reactive microservices that supports (at the framework level) Domain Driven Design.</li>
                        <li>The operating system of today is really unchanged since the Sun workstation of the 90’s. Yet everything else about software has really changed such as automation, build pipelines, and delivery.</li>
                        <li>Consul is first and foremost a centralized service registry that provides discovery. While it has a key-value store, it is Consul’s least important feature.</li>
